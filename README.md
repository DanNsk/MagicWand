# MagicWand
Scripts to recognize Magic Wand with IR reflector gestures and execute predefined actions on Raspberry PI w/ Pi Camera


Idea came from https://github.com/sean-obrien/rpotter/blob/master/rpotter.py but it didn't work for me - script wasn't able  to recognize gestures properly, I decided to follow a bit more simple approach to track points, than optical flow.
